This lil project is dedicated to exploring how machine translation can contribute to sentence simplification for Russian.


It includes the following steps:
* ##### Translating sentence simplification corpus WikiLarge from English to Russian 
* ##### Evaluating all the data and analyzing its main features
* ##### Finetuning mBart on the original and translated data
* ##### Evaluating the quality of simplification on the dev part of an original Russain dataset presented for RuSimpleSentEval competition


Following the steps, there will be  4 notebooks:
* ##### *Basic_evaluation_and_translation_with_Transformers*: the data preprocessing, translation and evaluation
* ##### *Simplification_Baselines*: making trivial and non-trivial baselines +
* ##### *Simplification_model*: fine tuning mBart on the data +
* ##### *Simplification Evaluation*: evaluation of simplifications +
